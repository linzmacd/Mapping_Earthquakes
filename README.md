# Earthquake Mapping Project

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to visualize fault lines and recent earthquakes on an interactive map. 

## Methods

We used the Leaflet library to populate a Mapbox map with current earthquake data pulled directly from the USGS website. The geographical coordinates and earthquake magnitudes were retrieved from the USGS GeoJSON files using JavaScript and the D3 Library, then added to the map in layers. With the addition of pop up labels, a legend, additional map tile layers, and the ability to toggle between the layers, we created an interactive visualization that is both fun to play with and pleasing to the eye!
